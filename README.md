## Summary: exercise description
In a music group there are different types of musical instruments. There are wind, string and percussion instruments.
All instruments have their name and price as attributes. In addition, they have a method called play(). This is abstract in the instrument class and, therefore, must be implemented in the child classes. If a wind instrument is being played, the method must display on the console: "A wind instrument is playing", if a string instrument is being played: "A string instrument is playing" and if a percussion instrument is being played: "A percussion instrument is playing".
The loading process of a class only takes place once. It demonstrates that loading can be caused by the creation of the first instance of this class or by accessing a static member of it.
